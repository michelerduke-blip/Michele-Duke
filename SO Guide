Service Offering Review – Quick Reference Guide

Purpose: Determine whether each Service Offering supports your Level for Product.

⸻

What You’re Doing

For each Service Offering in the SharePoint list:
	1.	Read the Service Description
	2.	Review your Level for Product
	3.	Decide:
	•	Yes – It clearly supports your level
	•	No – It clearly does not
	•	Research Required – You cannot determine without clarification

⸻

Step 1: Quick First Pass (Required)

Move quickly. Trust your judgment.
	•	If it obviously supports your level → Select: Yes
	•	If it clearly does not apply → Select: No
	•	If unclear → Flag for follow-up

Do not overanalyze during this pass.

⸻

Step 2: Clarify If Needed

If a Service Offering is unclear:
	1.	Re-read the description carefully
	2.	Check any linked documentation
	3.	Contact:
	•	Functional Manager, or
	•	Resiliency Contact listed

If after outreach you still cannot confidently determine Yes or No:

→ Select: Research Required

Decision Standard

Use this simple test:

Does this Service Offering directly support, enable, or materially impact your Level for Product?

If the answer is not reasonably clear, it is not a Yes.

Important: Critical Path Clarification
	•	A separate effort by EBR will confirm Critical Path.
	•	You are not being asked to validate or confirm Critical Path alignment.
	•	Focus only on whether the Service Offering supports your Level for Product.
